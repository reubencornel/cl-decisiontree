This package provides an implementation of an algorithm that creates a decision tree.

It provides the following features

<ul>
<li> Classification of multiple classes of instances
<li> Handling attributes with continuous values (A bit clunky for the timebeing)
<li> Function for selecting attributes can be modified by changing the *attribute-selection-function* variable
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
To train a decision tree call the function <FONT FACE="courier">create-classifier </FONT>
function. This function requires a list of training instances.

A training instance can be created by calling the macro <FONT face="courier">define-instance</font>. 
This macro requires the first argument to be the name of the class to
which the instance belongs and the rest are list of attribute values.

The <font face="courier">create-classifier</font> returns the root
node of the decision tree. This inturn is used by
the <font face="courier">classify</font> function that classifies new
instances.

<h3>Continous values</h3>
Before passing a list of continous values to
the <FONT FACE="courier">create-classifier </FONT> function the
continous values need to be removed. As of now this is what the
algorithm that I have written does.

<ul>
<li> It sorts the instances based on the values of the attribute in
  ascending order
<li> Then for every instance in the list it check the value of the
  attribute and the class and identifies ranges where the classes are same
<li> It then replaces all the continuous values with symbols that were
  idenified by the previous step
<li> It returns a list of ranges and the corresponding symbols
</ul> 

This is done by the
function <font face="courier">generate-range-symbols</font>. When
trying to classify any new instance the continuous values need to be
replaced, this is done by the
function <font face="courier">replace-continuous-values</font>. This
function requires the range list generated by
the <font face="courier">generate-range-symbols</font> function, the
instance and the attribute that is supposed to be continous



<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li> Addition of rule post pruning
<li> A set of newer attribute selection functions
<li> Better method to define and use attributes with continous values
  (requesting suggestions)
  <ul>
    <li> I want to know if there is a means by which I can define
    instances with continous values such that when defining new
    instances the continous values are replaced automatically.
  </ul>
</ul>
