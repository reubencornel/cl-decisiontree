INTRODUCTION
------------
This package provides an implementation of an algorithm that can be used to build a decision tree.


FEATURES
--------
This package provides the following features

* Classification of multiple classes of instances
* Handling attributes with continuous values (A bit clunky for the timebeing)
* Function for selecting attributes can be modified by changing the *attribute-selection-function* variable

USAGE
-----

To use this package do
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'decisiontree)

TRAINING
--------

To build up a set of instances that could be used for training do the following

(defparameter <list-variable> nil)

(push (define-instance <class> <attr-value-pair> <attr-value-pair> ...) <list-variable>)

(create-classifier <list-variable>)

This returns the root node of the decision tree.


CLASSIFICATION
--------------

To classify an instance use 

(classify <root-node-of-the-tree> <instance>)

This returns the classification of the instance
If the tree has not been trained sufficiently it will throw an error
